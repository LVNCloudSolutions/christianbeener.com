# christianbeener.com - dynamic-frontend

## An evolving project

This version is built using static HTML, JavaScript, and tailwindCSS built during deployment. As this site grows, maintaing the content in HTML will not be ideal, so this version uses JavaScript to dynamically inject content into the page.

##### The GitHub Actions workflow is specified in the [static.yml](.github/workflows/static.yml) file.
